        <h2 className='sec-2-1'>WHY IS TATTOO CARE IMPORTANT?</h2>
        <p className='sec-2-1'>It’s well known that the healing process post-tattoo can be pretty unpleasant: itchiness, inflammation, irritability, and flaking are just a few of the side effects you may experience. Incorporating a skin and body care routine that promotes soothing relief and skin barrier support, will not only help the healing process but keep your ink looking its best for longer.</p>

          <h2>DO CLEAN INGREDIENTS MATTER?</h2>
          <p>Short answer: Yes. The road to long-lasting ink begins with what you’re putting on your skin- from healing to daily care. Each ingredient should serve a purpose: soothe, moisturize, promote elasticity, help boost skin’s ability to regenerate and increase ink vibrancy and longevity. Clean ingredients are often better tolerated by even the most sensitive skin with many being biocompatible - aka easily recognized by skin. If it’s not providing a direct benefit, we don’t want it.</p>

          <h3>MAD RABBIT MAKES AN IMPACT STRIVING TOWARDS SUSTAINABILITY</h3>
          <p>MRT packaging is made with fully-recyclable materials.</p>
          <p>In April 2021 Mad Rabbit became a carbon neutral company through the acquisition of carbon offsets. As an all-natural aftercare company, we never test our products on animals and are 100% cruelty-free.</p>
          <p>We believe our impact goes beyond the products we produce and advocate for leaving the world a little bit better than when we started. In using carbon offsets, we support specific initiatives globally to offset carbon through sustainable practices. Developing countries often do not have the means to support environmentally friendly initiatives, so we decided to step up.</p>
