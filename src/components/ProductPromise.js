        <h1 className='sec-2-1'>WHY IS TATTOO CARE IMPORTANT?</h1>
        <p className='sec-2-1'>It’s well known that the healing process post-tattoo can be pretty unpleasant: itchiness, inflammation, irritability, and flaking are just a few of the side effects you may experience. Incorporating a skin and body care routine that promotes soothing relief and skin barrier support, will not only help the healing process but keep your ink looking its best for longer.</p>

          <h1>DO CLEAN INGREDIENTS MATTER?</h1>
          <p>Short answer: Yes. The road to long-lasting ink begins with what you’re putting on your skin- from healing to daily care. Each ingredient should serve a purpose: soothe, moisturize, promote elasticity, help boost skin’s ability to regenerate and increase ink vibrancy and longevity. Clean ingredients are often better tolerated by even the most sensitive skin with many being biocompatible - aka easily recognized by skin. If it’s not providing a direct benefit, we don’t want it.</p>
